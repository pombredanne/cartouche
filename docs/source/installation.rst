Installing ``cartouche``
========================

``cartouche`` is available on the `Python Package Index`_ (PyPI) and can be
installed with ``easy_install`` so long as you have `setuptools`_ installed
already::

  $ easy_install cartouche

Alternatively, you can download and unpack the source distribution from the
from PyPI and a GZipped tarball. You should then unpack the source
distribution into a temporary directory and run the setup script which will
install ``cartouche`` into the current Python environment, for example::

  $ tar xzf cartouche-1.1.2.tar.gz
  $ cd cartouche-1.1.2
  $ python setup.py install

Finally, you can get the source direct from the `repository`_ on Github.
